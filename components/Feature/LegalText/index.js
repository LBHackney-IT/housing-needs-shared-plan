      <h3>About this plan</h3>
      <p>
        The Council gives you a personal housing plan after your assessment. The
        aim of the plan is to try and make sure you have somewhere suitable to
        live for at least the next 6 months. It sets out the steps that you and
        the Council must take to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>stop you becoming homeless</li>
        <li>find housing if you've already lost your home</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Council asks you to agree to any steps included in the plan. If you
        don't agree, the Council decides what steps you must take and records
        the reasons you disagree on the plan.
      </p>

              refused to cooperate with the council or have deliberately and
              unreasonably refused to undertake one or more of the actions
              agreed within your personal housing plan.
