# Shared Plan
A tool that helps create a shared plan of action between a Hackney resident and the professionals supporting them.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  yarn
  ```

2. Create a .env file, based on the .env.sample file:
  ```bash
  touch .env # then go fill it in!
  ```

3. Set up DynamoDB local:
  Install Java if you don't already have it
  Install dynamodb:
  ```bash
  sls dynamodb install
  ```

4. Create local DynamoDB plans table:
  ```bash
  aws dynamodb create-table --cli-input-json file://./config/tables/plans.json --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
  ```

5. Run the development server:
  ```bash
  yarn dev
  ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the home page.

## AWS permissions

In order to schedule reminders, the user running `sls deploy` requires AWS EventBridge permissions. These may not be set already if the user was created prior to EventBridge being generally available.

You can add these permissions to the policy assigned to the IAM user or group in the AWS console.

## Unit tests

Run jest tests:

```bash
yarn unit-test
```

## Integration tests

Set these env vars in .env file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api  SMS_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
ENV=dev

# must match the name of the DynamoDB table
PLANS_TABLE_NAME=plans

# for authentication, any values are fine
JWT_SECRET=secret
ALLOWED_GROUPS=any_value_is_fine

# for Google Tag Manager, can be left blank
NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID=
```

#### Run cypress integration tests headlessly:
1. Set these env vars to the same values as your local aws cli config:
  ```
  CYPRESS_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID  
  CYPRESS_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY  
  CYPRESS_AWS_REGION  
  ```

2. Run the tests:
  ```bash
  yarn run int-test
  ```

#### Run tests in cypress test runner:
1. Start shared-plan and mock-sms servers:
  ```bash
  yarn start-cypress-servers
  ```

2. Open the test runner:
  ```bash
  yarn cypress-open
  ```
